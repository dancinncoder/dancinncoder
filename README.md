## **Why DancinnCoder?**

Because I am a coder who likes to dance 💃

## **So tell me about yourself !**

## **What makes you special as a developer?**

**I can answer with two keywords** : digital marekting / language

1️⃣ I have B2B digital marketing insights due to the 2 years of field experience as a digital marketing specialist focusing on planning campaign landing pages and content creation.

2️⃣ I have proven hands-on experience in developing commercial e-commerce/static websites using modern tech stacks such as JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js, Node.js, SCSS and SaSS.
